# JetsonNanoTomatoTester
Description: Uses a Jetson Nano to tell whether a tomato is ripe or not.

This project uses an Nvidia Jetson Nano. Set up for the nano can be found [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit). Note that you will need to purchase your own micro USB and micro SD card in order to use this kit.

After following these instructions you should be able to access a docker container on your nano that will allow you access to a JupyterLab server. In this server you should be able to access the classification_interactive.ipyn file under the folder /classification. In order to run the tomato testing code change the code under the "Task" section in the file to the task.py code posted here.
